Notes for Simpsons PC.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Running the game.

The game can be run in full screen or windowed mode.  The simpsons executable defaults to
fullscreen mode, as this is how most players will want to play the game.

Display options can be set from the main menu.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Closing the game.

The game can be quit from the main menu.  Additionally, in windowed mode, it may be quit
by closing the window (except when loading, this is a future possibility).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. User controls.

Simpsons now works with all controllers: gamepad, joystick, wheel, mouse, and keyboard.

The controller screen has been redesigned and is still under development.  The current
screen lets the player map buttons for a number of functions.

For reference, these are the current keyboard mappings, some of which are not configurable
from the controller screen:
