<h1>
Using the PlayStation2 IPU Stream Exporter Plug-in for Adobe Premiere for
Windows</h1>

<center><b>Version 1.0</b>
<br>Mike Dean, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe
<br>10th February 2000</center>

<p><br>
<h2>
Installing</h2>
To install the exporter plug-in, place the file ‘CMPM-PlayStation2 IPU
Stream.prm’ into the appropriate plug-ins directory used by Adobe Premiere
(such as 'C:\Program Files\Adobe\Premiere 5.1\Plug-ins').
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%">Using</h2>
To invoke the exporter plug-in, select the File/Export/Movie item from
the menu bar (the timeline should be the active window for the option to
be available). In the file requestor which consequently opens, click on
the 'Settings...' button.
<p>In the 'General Settings' menu of the dialog box which then opens is
a 'PlayStation2 IPU Stream' option which should be selected.
<p>Select the 'work area' required, and ensure that the 'Open When Finished'
checkbox is unticked.
<p>When the General Settings dialog has been dismissed and a filename for
the exported stream has been specified, a window will appear requesting
details of compression settings. In the current version of the exporter,
the only option available is a setting for the maximum size, in bytes,
of compressed frame images.
<h3>
Previewing</h3>
The files output by this exporter conform to the '.ipu' file format, and
can be previewed using the 'ezmovie' application featured in the sample
code of the development software.
